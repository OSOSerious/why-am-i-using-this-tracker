# Why Am I Using This? Tracker

## Purpose
Tracks app usage and patterns and gives feedback on which apps or activities are draining time without real benefit.

## How It Works
Monitors app usage in the background and prompts users with questions like, “Why are you using this app?” or “Did this session achieve what you intended?” It encourages mindful use of digital time.

## Why It’s Different
Instead of just showing usage statistics, it encourages self-reflection, making users more aware of the impact of certain apps on their time and mood.

## Project Ideas
### Advanced user analytics
* Enhance the existing app to provide more detailed analytics on user behavior.
* Implement features to track user engagement, session duration, and app usage patterns.
* Provide visualizations and reports to help users understand their digital habits better.
* Integrate machine learning algorithms to predict and suggest ways to improve productivity.

### Mood and productivity correlation
* Extend the current app to track the user's mood and correlate it with app usage.
* Implement a feature to prompt users to log their mood at regular intervals.
* Analyze the data to find patterns and provide insights on how certain apps affect the user's mood and productivity.
* Create visualizations to help users understand the impact of their digital habits on their well-being.

### Gamification of mindful app usage
* Add gamification elements to the existing app to encourage mindful app usage.
* Implement a reward system for users who achieve their productivity goals or reduce time spent on non-productive apps.
* Create challenges and milestones to keep users engaged and motivated.
* Provide a leaderboard to foster a sense of competition and community among users.
